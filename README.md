# Supply Chain Optimization Project

This project focuses on analyzing supply chain data to optimize inventory management, reduce costs, improve delivery times, and identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies. The analysis uses two datasets: **Sample Superstore** and **Deliveries**, providing insights into sales performance, profit trends, and delivery efficiency.

## Introduction

Supply chain management is critical for optimizing operations and improving profitability in businesses. This project utilizes data analysis techniques to uncover hidden patterns and recommend improvements for better supply chain performance.

---

## Objective

- Analyze supply chain data for performance improvement.
- Identify trends in sales, profit, and delivery efficiency.
- Optimize inventory by identifying profitable and slow-moving products.
- Reduce delivery times and identify bottlenecks.

---

## Datasets

1. **Sample Superstore Dataset**
   - Contains information about sales, profit, product categories, and shipping modes.
2. **Deliveries Dataset**
   - Contains IPL match delivery data (for modeling supply chain performance concepts).
